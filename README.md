# Description

Events allows events such as webinars or conferences to be created via a custom post type; categories, excerpt, details, start and end dates and times and a featured image are all supported.

In the options set defaults for the widget and shortcode.

Multiple widgets can be created, each assigned to display a category; settings for title, image size and limit for number of events to list can be set per widget.

The `event` shortcode accepts three parameters:
 * `slug` to select specific event.
 * `width` to set the size of the featured image.
 * `height` to set the size of the featured image.
 
Shortcode usage is `[event slug="december-2021" width=150 height=150]`; all parameters are optional and will use the defaults set via the settings page if not supplied.

The `events` shortcode accepts four parameters:
 * `category` to restrict the output to the selected category.
 * `width` to set the size of the featured image.
 * `height` to set the size of the featured image.
 * `limit` to restrict the number of events to display.
 
Shortcode usage is `[events category="webinars" width=150 height=150 limit=5]`; all parameters are optional and will use the defaults set via the settings page.
